**Template Permissions** 
* If You are creating a new import template than only you have the permission to make changes in that template.
* You have permission to modify and create new columns in that template.
* But if other user is using that template then he cant add new columns or modify it.
* He can only use that template to create and update the products.
* So the template permission has been given to the one who created it.
