If a product is of different sellers than pricing can be different for different seller. That way Product Unique will be same for sellers and for every seller fill the pricing details. You can import dynamic pricing through columns or rows. One row will have the values of one dynamic pricing for one seller. You can import multiple dynamic pricing values for one seller, with the values of pricing along with the Unique key of Product and seller.
