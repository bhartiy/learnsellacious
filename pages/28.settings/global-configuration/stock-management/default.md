**Stock Management**: You can choose at what level the stock value can be set. If set to ‘Use Global Setting’ it would not be possible to enter stock at category level and product level, and once the stock ends the product will be marked as out of stock.

You can Manage stock from 3 ways:
1. From 'use global setting'
2. From 'use category setting'
3. From 'use individual product setting'

**Default intitial stock**: Set a default initial stock value for all products, this can be overridden in the category if stock management is set to category level. You can change the initial stock by scroll bar placed on the text box.

**Default over stock limit**: Set a default over stock sales limit value for all products, this can be overridden in the category if stock management is set to category level.

**Check Stock in Front-end**: If check stock in front-end is enable, it will check stock on frontend and show message "Insufficient stock" if stock is not present in that quantity.
