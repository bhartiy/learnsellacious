Not all countries follow same address formate, Address Preset feature inables us to predefine set of address format for different countries.
We have already provided set of address formate which can be seen under Address Preset menu in settings.

You can Edit or Add new address preset from here. The option provided in this feature are as follows
**Title:** Title for address preset
**Applied on Countries:** Select applied countries for this address preset in this field. **NOTE-** Only one address preset can be applied to one counrty so avoid selecting countries which are aleady present on other presets or remove ot from other preset and then you can add here.
