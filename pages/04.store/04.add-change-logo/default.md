In sellacious, you can change the logo of your site easily. To do this, go to Joomla administrator your site. You can Joomla administrator yoursite.com/administrator.

Now, go to **Extensions > Templates.**

Select the style or layout, in which you want to change the logo. 
Note: If you have more than one layout applied to your site you'll need to change the logo in all those layouts.

For example: In sellacious Squick, we are using two layouts, default and left sidebar, while in js-kart we're using three layouts. 

Now, in the **Basic tab**, you can change the logo for your site.

You can change or add the favicon and many from this section.
