There are two ways to upgrade a free license to premium license.

**1. From sellacious backend:** To upgrade your site from free to premium, you can purchase the premium license. To do this go to the sellacious backend of your site and click on the license information. A window will open which will show the license information.

Click on 'Change or Upgrade' and licenses available on sellacious will open.

Select the license you want to activate, click on it and purchase the license. The premium license is activated now on previous license key.
