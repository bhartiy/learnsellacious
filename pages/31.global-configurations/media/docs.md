**Media:** 
This Page lets you manage images and attachments directly from a folder on your website, where you can directly upload the files via FTP or cPanel etc.
The standard way to upload the images in the product is to save each file/image in the edit pages of products, categories, special categories, etc wherever applicable.
If you have uploaded files from the edit page of products and also provided a matching path for it below, then images/files from both places would be combined in the output.
