This guide will help you with the quick steps to building your Awesome store using sellacious. Ideally, it should not take more than 10 min to create an online store. Sellacious is a "download and install" software and not a SAAS, that means you need your own server to run it. 

Sellacious runs on Joomla CMS. To cut the complications we have created a Quickstart package. It contains Sellacious, Joomla, a Free Template, several modules, plugins, etc. When installed, it will create a replica of our Demo. This is very useful when you want to experience sellacious quickly. Installing from JED or web is recommended for more advanced users, who understand how Joomla and Sellacious works. 

Sellacious also provides Package for installing directly on Joomla. For more details, we created an entire section on installation in this documentation. 

If you are curious about the use cases, ideal usage of sellacious, you should read our Use case section, Feature section.
