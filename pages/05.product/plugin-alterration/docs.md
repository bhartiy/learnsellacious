Import templates can be altered using Plugins:

You can create one or more Plugins to alter the templates.
Through these plugins you can add columns or make changes in the Default templates.
If you want to add columns apart from the Default Columns in the imported template you can create plugins.

Through Plugin you can work on either one of the action, two of them or on all of them.
