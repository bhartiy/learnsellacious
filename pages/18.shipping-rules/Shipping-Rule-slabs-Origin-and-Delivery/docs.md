Origin and Delivery location can be added to shipping rule slabs now in sellacious. Now we can set range(min-max) and also origine/delivery locations to slab rates. To enable this option follow these steps-

1. Enable **Shipping Rule Slabs By Import** from **Settings->Global Configuration->Shipment**
