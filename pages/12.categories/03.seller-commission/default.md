Seller category and product category commissions are vice versa. Whatever commission is decided in any category like product or seller, it will refelect in other category.

**3. From Seller Profile:** Also, seller commission will also define from the seller profile too. Whatever commission is define in seller profile, it will be on first priority than seller/product category.

* Go to the seller profile and edit the profile.
* Click on the seller commission tab in seller profile.

* Save the seller profile.
* On every purchase, seller commission will deduct and credit to the shop owner account.
