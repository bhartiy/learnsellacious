New view added for managing Listing Types in Sellacious backend. Listing types and item conditions can be managed from here. Admin can add listing type and add item conditions there itself. 

Translations can be added for both Listing types and item conditions. 

Published listing types and item conditions will be loaded in Product edit.

If seller categories are selected in "Allowed User Groups", then it will be only allowed to such sellers when editing product.
