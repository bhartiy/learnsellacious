Hyperlocal is a major feature of sellacious. With the help of hyperlocal you can create your own store for local or international buyers. 

This hyperlocal package consists of a module and plugin. Which both are already built in sellacious latest version 1.6.0. We are upgrading this feature of sellacious day by day. 

_Hyperlocal is compatible to the sellacious version 1.6.x and above. If your site isn't updated yet to the latest sellacious, please update it to use hyperlocal and many more exciting feature of sellacious._

After installing the sellacious version 1.6.x and above, to use hyperlocal go to the Sellacious backend > Settings. In Global configuration, you'll see the tab for hyperlocal settings.
