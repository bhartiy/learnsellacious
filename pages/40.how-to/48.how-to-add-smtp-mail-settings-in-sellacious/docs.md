Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the set of Internet standards for transmitting email across Internet networks. If you have an email provider, the best way to utilize that email within your Joomla site is to configure the SMTP settings in the Global Configurations area.

To configure your SMTP settings-
Go to Joomla Administrator >> System >> Global Configuration
Locate **mail settings **

Here you can fill the fields according to your email provider.

## **For gmail**
