Global custom field functionality is added in sellaciosu now. A custom field can be set as global at the time of adding it. A global custom field will appear as read only in all the product categories and relavant edit fields for other attributes.

To create a global custom field follow these steps. Here we take a product attribute example but same can be done for other attributes too-

1. To make a global custom field of product attribute go to Aditional Attribute->Product Attributes
