**Compatibility:** Sellacious v2.0.0-Beta1+

This feature enables sellers to change status of all the items in an order at once rather than changing it one by one. 
To enable this feature go to Shop **Settings->Order Status Change** and set it to **Order.**

If order consits of more that one seller's item, bulk change can be done sellerwise.

It can be seen here that status of all the item is changed

**Note:** On Seller Login - Seller will only see their own order status, not main order's status and main order status will be according to all the item order status.
