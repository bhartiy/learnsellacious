Whole store timing functionality is divided in three parts-
### #### ## 1. Store availability[](https://www.sellacious.com/documentation-v2#/learn/marketplace/store-availability)
2. Delivery availability
3. Pickup Availability

**Store availability:**
(available in version 2.0-beta1)

This enables the sellers to show stores status(open/close) on their store page. Store’s time zone and today's timing also shown prominently. To use store availability feature-

1. Enable Store availability from Settings>>Global Configuration>>Store timing Settings. Here Enable store availability is to enable this functionality for sellers, Show store availability is to show store status on the store page. Likewise Enable store timing enables store timing functionality and Show store timing is to show it on the store page. This configuration can be overridden from the seller profile.
