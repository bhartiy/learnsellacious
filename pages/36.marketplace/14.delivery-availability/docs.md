### Delivery Availability:

Delivery Availability enables sellers to show delivery timing on their store page and process the order in time slots. Delivery functionality is divided in two scopes.
A. [Product Scope](https://www.sellacious.com/learn/marketplace/product-and-shipping-scope#product-scope)
B. [Shipping Scope](https://www.sellacious.com/learn/marketplace/product-and-shipping-scope#shipping-scope)

We will learn about these two in detail later in this chapter. First We will cover the initial configuration of the delivery plugin.

1. Enable delivery availability from **Settings->Global Configuration->Store timing Settings**. Here **Enable Delivery availability** is to enable this functionality for sellers, **Show Delivery availability** is to show Delivery status on the store page. Likewise **Enable Delivery timing** enables store timing functionality and S**how Delivery timing** is to show it on the store page. This configuration can be overridden from the seller profile.

2. Configure delivery timing for each day and other parameters of delivery in seller backend profile or frontend edit profile.
