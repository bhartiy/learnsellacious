Shipping Scope: 

In shipping scope, a seller has the option to define shipping rules for the delivery slots. 



After choosing shipping scope sellers can set Slot duration, Slot padding(time between two delivery slots), and Preparation time from the seller profile.



Creating shipping rules for slots is the most important step in this case. Delivery shipping rules can be created when you choose the shipping scope.

In delivery shipping, rates can be defined for Next hours, Days, and for the same day. When it comes to rates for slots, Flat rate can be defined for all-day slots also individually for weekdays slots.





NOTE: Delivery type shipping rules can only be created for sellers(not site-wide) and only one rule per seller. This only can be used when Shipped by Seller and Shipping selection is Sellerwise or Product wise.

Once the delivery shipping is enabled, the buyer will get the option to select shipping for the shop in the shipping step.


Selected slot and shipping will reflect in summary and can be edited from here.
